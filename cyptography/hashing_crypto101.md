# Hashing - Crypto 101

An introduction to Hashing,

## Task 1 Key Terms 

Before we start, you need to get some jargon out of the way.

Encoding - This is NOT a form of encryption, just a form of data representation like base64 or hexadecimal. Immediately reversible.

Hash - A hash is the output of a hash function. Hashing can also be used as a verb, "to hash", meaning to produce the hash value of some data.

Brute force - Attacking cryptography by trying every different password or every different key

Cryptanalysis - Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the underlying maths
This room will likely involve some research. Get good at using search engines, it's crucial to infosec.
